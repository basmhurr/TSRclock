# TSRclock
a C program example to use the TSR(terminate and stay resident)
Note: i took the example from a website and added the keep() function.

i used DOSBOX with Borland C++ v2 to compile and test

to run the clock use clocktsr -I ( will show a clock at upper left screen corner)
to stop the clock use clocktsr -U
